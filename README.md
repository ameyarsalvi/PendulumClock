# Torque Control in Pendulum Clock

This projects creates a mathematical model for a Pendulum Clock so that the Escapement Mechanism- which controls the motion of the Pendulum can be viewed as a Feedback Control System. This helps us to control the amount of torque that can be delivered to the Pendulum, and all the hands of the clock , so that energy losses in the Clock can be studied.

The Simulink Model of the system looks like:

The strokes of the escapement and the resulting motion of the pendulum can be visualized from the first and last row of these plots:
